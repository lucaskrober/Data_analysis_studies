##-------- Tidy data case study ------------------------------------------

# The case study uses individual-level mortality data from Mexico. The goal is to find
# causes of death with unusual temporal patterns within a day that differ most from this
# pattern.
# 
# The full dataset "data_row/deaths08.csv.bz2" has information on 539,530 deaths in Mexico
# in 2008 and 55 variables, including the location and time of death, the cause of death, and
# the demographics of the deceased.
# 
# The original dataset has been cleaned and the and only two columns "dt" and "cod" are remained
# in the tidy dataset "data/deaths.csv.bz2
